# BACKLOG.md — Sublore build plan

Ordered milestones for v1.0 (scope: CLAUDE.md §1). Rules: work top to bottom; a milestone's tasks are detailed by the orchestrator when the milestone starts, using M0 as the template; every task gets acceptance criteria BEFORE implementation; the owner's checklist at the end of each milestone is the definition of done.

Status legend: `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` verified-by-tests · `[✓]` owner-passed · `[!]` blocked

## M0 — Skeleton that proves the stack (fully specified, start here)

Goal: a running Tauri 2 app on Windows and Linux that plays a video with libmpv and has green CI. This milestone exists to kill stack risk first: if libmpv embedding fails, we learn it in week one, not month three.

- [~] **M0.1 Repo bootstrap.** Tauri 2 + Rust core + TS frontend, workspace layout, lint/format hooks, README stub.
  - AC: `npm run tauri dev` opens a window titled Sublore on Windows and Linux; CI runs lint + build on both and is green.
  - Status 2026-08-22: implementation merged to `main` locally; full check battery (install, format, lint, build, fmt, clippy, cargo build) plus live app launch with window title verified on Linux. Remote publication deferred by owner, so the CI-green and Windows halves of the AC are unverified.
- [ ] **M0.2 libmpv embedding.** Video renders inside the app window via libmpv, with play/pause and seek.
  - AC: open fixture `fixtures/video/sample.mkv`; video plays with audio; pause, seek to 0:30, frame changes accordingly; app closes cleanly with no orphan process.
- [ ] **M0.3 Packaging smoke.** CI produces installable artifacts (msi/exe, deb + AppImage).
  - AC: artifact from CI installs and runs M0.2's behavior on a clean VM of each OS.
- [ ] **M0.4 Crash safety baseline.** Panic/error handler; log file in app data dir; no console spam in release.
  - AC: forced error path shows an actionable dialog and writes the log; app restarts normally after.
- [ ] **M0.5 E2E smoke harness.** tauri-driver + WebDriver behavioral test asserting the app launches with window title Sublore, wired into CI. Filed from M0.1: title verification there was manual (Xvfb + xdotool), WORKFLOW §2 wants it automated.
  - AC: a CI job on Linux runs the E2E smoke; the test fails if the window title is not "Sublore"; removing the harness or skipping the test turns CI red.

**Owner checklist M0:** install from CI artifact on your machine → open a video → play, pause, seek → close → reopen. Everything behaves; nothing left running in task manager.

## M1 — Subtitle formats, lossless

Goal: open and save SRT, ASS, VTT without destroying anything, including files from the wild.
Draft criteria: round-trip fixtures (CRLF/LF, BOM, overlapping cues, non-Latin scripts, malformed lines) byte-stable for supported fields; atomic writes + rolling backups per CLAUDE.md §3; malformed input produces a readable error, never a crash or a silent fix.

## M2 — Editor with video and waveform

Goal: the free product's core: cue list, text editing, timing adjust against waveform, side-by-side source/target view.
Draft criteria: edit 2,000-line file with no visible lag; every edit undoable; timing changes audible/visible against waveform; owner can subtitle a 1-minute clip start to finish without touching another tool.

## M3 — Local transcription

Goal: whisper.cpp sidecar producing editable, word-timestamped cues.
Draft criteria: model download is explicit and resumable; transcription runs off the main thread, shows progress, cancels cleanly; Vulkan used when present, CPU fallback verified; output loads straight into the editor as cues.

## M4 — Projects

Goal: SQLite project (series → episodes → files) so memory has somewhere to live.
Draft criteria: create/open project; episodes retain their files and state across restarts; schema migration test green; deleting a project never touches user media or subtitle originals.

## M5 — Termbase + QA (pro, closed module)

Goal: the product. Per-project glossary with approved renderings; QA pass flags every target line where a source term appears without its approved rendering.
Draft criteria: on the standard fixture episode, QA flags exactly the planted violations and nothing else; term added mid-series retro-flags earlier episodes on demand; module absent → core runs untouched, module present + licensed → features appear.

## M6 — Translation memory + licensing + release

Goal: exact and fuzzy TM across the whole project; offline license check; pay-once purchase flow via merchant of record; v1.0 tag.
Draft criteria: repeated lines in later episodes surface their earlier translation; fuzzy matches ranked and insertable; license file validates offline, invalid license degrades gently to free core; both installers pass the full owner checklist end to end.

## Parking lot (explicitly not v1 — do not pull forward)

Karaoke/typesetting · diarization · built-in LLM translation beyond BYOK hook · macOS activation · auto-updater · batch CLI. Anything an agent wants to add lands here first and waits for the owner.
